# textSeparator


HTML page that separates provided text into pieces of 5000 characters max (unless a paragraph is longer than that).

Made because I needed to copy a lot of text into Google Translate and it has a character limit of 5000.

### To change word limit: edit the numbers on lines 28 and 35.
